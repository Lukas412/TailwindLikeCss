# Tailwind Like CSS

This is not ment for large or production projects.

For some small personal projects setting up tailwind and a build system can be a bit much.

In this case you can just include the `tailwindlike.css` file into the project. \
It has all style and is therefore very large. Tailwind prevents this with a build step.

## Usage

Copy the tailwindlike.css from the releases tab into you project!

### Generate

To generate the current tailwindlike.css run the `generate.py` script:

    python generate.py
